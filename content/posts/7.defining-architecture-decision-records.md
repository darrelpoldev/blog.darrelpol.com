## What is Architecture Decision Records or ADR?

One of the best ways to document an architecture decision is through Architecture Decision Records or [ADRs](https://adr.github.io/). ADR is an **art to making architecture decisions**. But, what exactly is an ADR? 

According to Michael Keeling on [TechLead Journal](https://techleadjournal.dev/episodes/113/), "*an ADR is a simple text file describing the context, the decision, and the consequences of a single architectural decision stored in the version control repository.*". 

On this blog, I'm going to talk about a process that you can use to start documenting your architecture decisions using ADR.

## Basic structure

The basic structure of an ADR consists of five main sections: Title, Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences. Of course, you can extend it and add more fields if you like, but I recommend keeping the decision record to be concise and small as you can so that it doesn't turn into a huge document that nobody will ever read. 

### Title
Titles are usually numbered sequentially and contains a short phrase describing the architecture decision. In my opinion, this is the best way to refer to a decision, as the numbers can serve as an identifier and can be easily remembered. For example, a decision to use asynchronous messaging between two microservices, let's call them Order and payment services, might read something like this: "1. Use of Asynchronous Messaging Between Order and Payment Services.". The title should be short and descriptive enough to remove ambiguity about the context of the decision.

### Status
The status of an ADR can be marked as follows:
- PROPOSED
- ACCEPTED
- SUPERSEDED

**PROPOSED** - Proposed status means the decision must be approved by either a higher-level decision maker or some sort of architectural governance body. You can think about this governance body as a group of people that can "approve" the decision.

**ACCEPTED** - Accepted status means the decision has been approved and is ready for implementation.

**SUPERSEDED** - A status of *Superseded* means the decision has been changed and superseded by another ADR. This status assumes the prior ADR was accepted; in other words, a proposed ADR would never be superseded by another ADR, but rather continued to be modified until accepted. Superseded status is a powerful way of keeping historical record of what decision were made, why they were made at that time, and what a new decision is and why it was changed. As an example, assume ADR 69 ("Use of Asynchronous Messaging Between Order and Payment Services") was previously approved, but due to later changes to the implementation and location of the Payment Service, REST must now be used between the two services (ADR 420). The status would look like this:
```
ADR 69. Use of Asynchronous Messaging Between Order and Payment Services
	Status: Superseded by 420
ADR 420. Use of REST Between Order and Payment Services
	Status: Accepted, supersedes 69
```

The link and history trail between ADRs 69 and 420 avoid the inevitable “what about using messaging?” question regarding ADR 420.

#### ADRs and Request for Comments (RFC)
Sometimes, there's a need to **Request for Comments** on a particular decision. In these cases, you can use something like this:
```
STATUS:
    Request For Comments, Deadline 03 NOV 2022
```
Use RFC status if you need to validate some assumptions or to find an answer that needs to be documented. By recommendation, it's also a good practice to specify a deadline date when that review will be completed. This will avoid the inevitable Analysis Paralysis where a decision is forever discussed but never actually made. 

### Context
The Context section specifies the forces at play for the decision. In other words, "what situation is forcing me to make this decision?". You can describe here the specific situation or issue and concisely elaborate on the possible alternatives. This section can also provide a way to document the architecture diagram or other artifacts. I recommend to including the artifacts as an image or screenshot to avoid possible undocumented changes. 

Continuing with the example from the previous section, the context might look something like this: *"The order service must pass information to the payment service to pay for an order currently being placed. This could be done using REST or asynchronous messaging."* Notice that this concise statement not only specified the scenario, but also the alternatives. 

### Decision
The Decision section of the ADR contains the architecture decision, along with a full justification for the decision. Michael Nygard introduced a great way of stating an architecture decision by using a very affirmative, commanding voice rather than a passive one. For example, the decision to use asynchronous messaging between services would read “we will use asynchronous messaging between services.” This is a much better way of stating a decision as opposed to “I think asynchronous messaging between services would be the best choice.” Notice here it is not clear what the decision is or even if a decision has even been made—only the opinion of the author is stated.

### Consequences
This section documents the overall impact of the decision. Every decision has some sort of impact, both good and bad. Having to specify the impact of an architecture decision forces the author and the governance body to think about whether those impacts outweigh the benefits of the decision. 

### Compliance (optional)
The compliance section is optional and not a standard section in an ADR. The best way to understand compliance is to answer these questions, "how can you comply to this decision?" or "what are the steps you need to comply to this decision?". This section is also where you could document the action items to measure and govern the decision from a compliance perspective. 

### Notes (optional)
Another optional section is Notes. This where you can add metadata for the decision such as consulted people, important timelines, or any other information that can support the ADR. If you're not planning to use a versioning tool for your ADRs, you can use this section to document information like, original author, approval date, approved by, last modified date, modified by, etc. 

I recommend using a bullet point for the Notes details and make the information as small as you can so that it's concise and easier to read. 

## Storage
Regardless of where ADRs are stored, each architecture decision should have its own file. IMO, the best way to store your ADRs is to use git repository. That way, all decisions are easily visible to the governance body and are part of your codebase. Although, it can also be on a wiki page if some members of the governing body doesn't have a git account or not a member of engineering team. To be honest, I'd start with git and format the files to `.md` so that it can be easily moved to a wiki page if needed.

## Processing an ADR
Below image is a simple illustration of an ADR lifecycle.

The process is very simple if you look at the lifecycle based on the status. Once you've created the ADR file and set the status to "Proposed" and added a context, you can then start "seeking for approval" by talking to the governance body or whoever needs to approve the decision. Once a decision is accepted, it can be superseded if the decision needs to be changed. Remember, a proposed ADR would never be superseded by another ADR, but rather continued to be modified until accepted.

## Sample ADR
```
## ADR 69. Asynchronous Pub/Sub Messaging Between Bidding Services

## STATUS
Accepted

## CONTEXT
The Bid Capture Service, upon receiving a bid from an online bidder or from a live bidder via the auctioneer, must forward that bid onto the Bid Streamer Service and the Bidder Tracker Service. This could be done using asynchronous point-to-point(p2p) messaging, asynchronous publish-and-subscribe(pup/sub) messaging, or REST via the Online Auction API Layer.

## DECISION
We will use asynchronous pub/sub messaging between the Bid Capture Service, Bid Streaner Service, and the Bidder Tracker Service.

The Bid Capture Service does not need any information back from the Bid Streamer Service or Bidder Tracker Service.

The Bid Streamer Service must receive bids in the exact order they were acceoted by the Bid Capture Service. Using messaging and queues automatically guarantees the bid order for the stream. 

Using Async pub/sub messaging will increase the performance of the bidding process and allow for extensibility for bidding information.

## CONSEQUENCES
We will require clustering and high availability of the message queues. 

Internal bid events will be bypassing security checks done in the API layer.

UPDATE: Upon review at the December 14, 2022 Architecture metting, the Architecture Team decided that this was an acceptable trade-off and no additional security checks would be needed for bid events between these services.

## COMPLIANCE
We will use periodic manual coad and design reviews to ensure that asynchronous pub/sub messaging is being used between the Bid Capture Service, Bid Streamer Service, and the Bidder Tracker Service.
